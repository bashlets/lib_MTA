1.1b1    05/20/09   Second public release of lib_MTA (beta)

		    Fixed parsing of recipients in relay functions to leave
		    commas in as a delimiter.

		    Fixed special filter script to exit 0 upon exit of the
		    special filter functions to prevent unwanted response from
		    the MTA.

		    Added alternate address response to the special filter.

		    Removed mandatory exit from the list_error_MTA function
		    to provide more programming flexibility.

		    Removed return_email_MTA from all the list filter functions
		    to provide more programming flexibility.

		    Added thorough parsing to the input_sender_MTA and
		    input_rcpts_MTA functions including bracket additon and
		    check for invalid email address(es).

		    Updated documentation to reflect the changes made, and
		    added cross-referencing of global variables to function
		    descriptions.

1.2    06/07/09     Major additions to the library, including the capability
                    to send attachments, the ability to supply optional
                    arguments to change global variable values on a per
                    function basis, and an extensive testing suite.

                    Error checking has been improved/extended.

                    The need for the external program 'formail' has been
                    removed in favor of an internal library function which
                    provides the same functionality.

                    Added the ability to supply the kill_vacation_MTA and
                    kill_mailer_errs_MTA functions with optional, custom
                    tokens.

                    Added a function to check for available file descriptors.

                    Added functions to use named pipe for openssl output.

                    Modified the add_footer_MTA function to handle alternative
                    html format as well as plain text.

                    The number of calls to 'sed' and 'grep' has been reduced
                    by approximately two-thirds by utilizing BASH regular
                    expression built-ins functionality more extensively.

                    There are now 58 functions in the library, as opposed to
                    38 in the initial release.

                    Updated documentation to reflect the changes made.
