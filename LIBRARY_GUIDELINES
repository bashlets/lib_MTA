                   **Lib_MTA Library Function Guidelines**
         (Rules the author tried to adhere to in writing the library.)

1) The purpose of a function is to provide convenience, coding excellence,
and simplicity to programming by preventing needless code repetition and
encapsulating programming tasks.  The purpose of a function library is to
prevent perpetual re-writing of code blocks to perform similar or identical
tasks.

2) Library functions should be named according to some convention, suitable
for indentifying the library and the function task.

3) ALL library functions should have ONE specific task.

5) Argument checking should be performed by ALL library functions, including
functions which take no arguments or optional arguments.

6) ALL library functions should return some value which reflects successful
or unsuccessful execution of the function task.

7) Library function variables should be local wherever possible.

8) Library functions which contain global variables should take optional
arguments to supplant global values.  This allows for greater utility to
function use.

9) Library functions should minimize reliance on other functions and on
external programs.

10) Calls within library functions should be limited to 3 levels.  This
applies to calls to externals, other library functions and recursion.
