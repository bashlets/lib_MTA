This software is a library of BASH shell script functions related to
electronic mail.  The distribution also includes ancillary scripts, example
files and documentation.  The library functions are aimed at two purposes,
relaying email and filtering outbound mailing list email.  After installation,
the full documentation of the library can be accessed as an info file by typing:
'info lib_MTA'.

The relaying functions allow you to write BASH scripts to relay email through
both local and remote Mail Transfer Agents, both with and without TLS and
authentication, just as any modern email client program would.  An example script
called 'email-gmail' is provided under the examples directory of the installation
(/usr/local/share/lib_MTA-{vers}/examples) which illustrates how to use the library
for this purpose using port 465.  The library provides three relay functions,
relay_25_MTA, for standard port 25 relaying of email, relay _465_MTA for
authenticated TLS encrypted relaying of email on port 465, and relay_587_MTA,
for STARTTLS with authentication relaying of email on port 587.

The list filtering functions are designed for use on large mailing lists,
which many corporations, universities and other large organizations maintain
to communicate with target groups of benefactors, employees, students,
customers, etc.  The filter functions provide capability for the following:

	Optional From: line rewrite (SPOOF)
	Optional Reply-To: line rewrite (SPOOF_REPLY)
	Optional sender authorization check (AUTH_REQUIRED)
	Optional attachment reject (NO_ATTACHMENTS)
	Optional vacation reply reject (NO_VACATION)
	Optional non-local posting rejection (MUST_BE_LOCAL)
	Optional footer (FOOTER)
	Optional Mailer error posting prevention (NO_MAIL_ERR)
	Optional Spam tag posting prevention (NO_SPAM)

A standard filtering script, called special_filter.sh is provided with the
library. You are free to use this script, as is, customize it for your needs,
or write a new filtering script using the library functions.  See the
README-LISTS file for instructions on how to set up lists with the standard
filter.
