The list filtering capability of the lib_MTA library relies on outbound list
emails being fed to a control script, or filter script, via stdin.  The email
list message is then temporarily saved to a file where it can be examined and
operated on, if necessary, by the filter script, before being fed back to the
MTA for delivery.  Thus, there is a loop involved, as shown in the following
diagram:


            Outbound List Email ------> Filter Script ---> Discard wi Reason
                    ^                         |            Back to Sender
     List           |                         |
     Msg From ---->MTA---> Out to list        |
     Sender         ^                         |  
                    |                         |
            Inbound Filtered Email <---- Modification

The loop requirement is not unique to the library filtering capability.
Majordomo and Mailman both use a similar loop configuration to that shown.                                                                                  
To set this up so that it works properly, a few simple steps need to be taken.
I assume you are using the real sendmail in the following discussion.  If you
are using another MTA, consult your MTA documentation for the equivilent steps.

All list file locations given are relative to the lib_MTA-(version) directory,
which is under /usr/local/share unless you modified the prefix with configure.

Step 1
------
The first step in setting up a filtered list is to put in place the three
required list files for the filter.  List file locations are relative to the
special_lists directory, which is /usr/local/share/lib_MTA{vers}/special_lists
These files are:

list_files/[listname]
cfg_files/[listname.cfg]
auth_files/[listname.auth]

There is an example file under each of these subdirectories for the example list
'testlist', which can be used as a template in creating your version of the
three required list files.  Descriptions of the three files are as follows:

    1) The list address file

     File Name:   [listname] (should be the same as the list)
                  (i.e. listname=mangos, file=mangos)
    
     Location:    Lives under special_lists/list_files.

     Consists of: The actual email addresses of the list members, one per
                  line. (See example file special_lists/list_files/testlist
                  for file format)

    2) The list configuration file

     File Name:   [listname.cfg]
                  (i.e. listname=mangos, file=mangos.cfg)

     Location:    Lives under special_lists/cfg_files

     Consists of: The filtering options for the list. (See example file
                  special_lists/cfg_files/testlist.cfg for file format)

    3) The list sender authorization file

     File Name:   [listname.auth]
                  (i.e. listname=mangos, file=mangos.auth)

     Location:    Lives under special_lists/auth_files

     Consists of: The email addresses, one per line, of authorized senders to
                  to the list.  The sender address in the authorization file
                  must match the From: address of the list email message in
                  order to pass the authorization check.  (See the example file
                  special_lists/auth_files/testlist.auth for file format)

Step 2
------
The second step is to examine the global configuration file, MASTER.cfg which
comes with the library.  This file is located under special_lists/cfg_files,
and sets the default local MTA for your list, as well as the location of key
list file directories and the names and locations of the list log files.
If you have done a default install of lib_MTA and are using the default
special_filter.sh supplied with the library,  the only variable you should have
to edit is local_MTA.  Set this to the fully qualified name of your local MTA,
as in someMTA.localhost.localdomain or myMTA.some.domain.  It needs to match
what your local MTA advertises itself as in the Received: headers.  If any of 
the other path names supplied in the file are not accurate because you changed
the default install location, change them so that they accurately reflect your
installation.

Step 3
------
There are two empty log files created by the installation which are located
under special_lists/logs: transaction.log and list_error.log.  Unless your
MTA runs as root, you will need to change the ownership of both the logs
directory and the log files to whatever user your mta runs as.  Otherwise,
the logging functionality of the filter will not work because the MTA will
not be able to write to the log files.  The user for sendmail  is usually
'mail' or 'sendmail'.

Step 4
------
The fourth step is to create two aliases in the aliases file for your MTA
(usually /etc/aliases for sendmail).  The first alias should be the list name,
and point to the filter.  If the list name is 'mangos', the alias should look
like this:

mangos: "|/usr/local/special_lists/filters/special_filter.sh mangos"

The pipe symbol | tells sendmail to execute the filter with the email message
piped to standard in.  Note that the mangos argument to the filter is required.

The second alias should point to the actual file of list addresses created
under Step 1.  For the 'mangos' list, this second alias should look something
ike this:

mangos-fl4kjla: :include: /usr/local/special_lists/list_files/mangos

The :include: directive in the alias tells sendmail that the file pointed to
contains a list of addresses, one per line.  The alias name itself can be
anything you like, but by convention, usually contains the name of the list
as the prefix.

After you create the aliases, the alias database needs to be updated.  If using
sendmail, the command to update the database is 'newaliases'.

Step 5
------
The fifth step is to set the 'FINAL' parameter in the list configuration file
you created under Step 1.  The 'FINAL' parameter is the alias name of the
second alias created under Step 4.  For the mangos list, the configuration
file would be special_lists/cfg_files/mangos.cfg and the entry should look
like this:

FINAL='mangos-fl4kjla'

Possibe Step 6 wi sendmail
--------------------------
When using sendmail, you wll also have to create a symbolic link to the filter
within the /etc/smrsh directory, if you have sendmail configured to use smrsh.
For a default install of the library, the link command would be something like:

ln -s /usr/local/share/lib_MTA-{vers}/special_lists/filters/special_filter.sh \
/etc/smrsh/special_filter.sh

where {vers} is the version of lib_MTA you have installed.

=================================================================================
Test your list after completing the above steps by swapping in a list address
file containing just your email address and emailing the list.  If everything
works, authorized senders to the list can begin using the list with the real
list address file.
